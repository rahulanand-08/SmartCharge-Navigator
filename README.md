# SmartCharge Navigator

**SmartCharge Navigator** is an advanced tool designed to streamline the process of finding and navigating to EV (Electric Vehicle) charging stations. This application integrates data from multiple major EV charging networks into a single platform, allowing users to easily locate nearby charging stations and receive optimized route guidance.

## Key Features

- **Unified Access**: Merges information from various EV charging networks into one application, eliminating the need to use multiple apps.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest distance to the nearest charging station, optimizing route planning.
- **Estimated Travel Time**: Provides real-time travel time estimates based on the shortest path and a default speed of 40 km/h.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Delivers an intuitive interface for easy navigation and access to charging station availability.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core language for implementing algorithms and data handling.
- **Priority Queue**: Used for efficient shortest path calculations.
- **Graph Data Structure**: Represents locations and distances in the network.
